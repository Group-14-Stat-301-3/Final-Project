# Data Source
For this project, we will be using the 2019-2020 Major League Baseball Regular Season dataset containing batting statistics for players with at least 100 plate appearances for both years. 
Specifically, predictors within this dataset vary from measures of physical strength such as sprint speed and arm strength, batting statistics such as plate appearances, on base plus slugging 
percentages, and player information such as age and name. This data is obtained from the website Baseball Savant, found at https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/. This dataset is what Jordi used for 
his 301-1 final project in the fall. 

The specific "custom leaderboard" we plan to use to pull this data is found at http://bit.ly/JordiParryProjectDataMLB

# Project Timeline
We plan to load in and clean the data in the next week and to begin our EDA right away once the data is in. After the EDA due date, we plan to get to work on building models and tuning parameters.

# Research Question
Can we predict a player's on-base plus slugging using his advanced metrics? This is a predictive question and one that is best answered using a regression-based approach.

The response variable is `on_base_plus_slg`, which is the player's on-base percentage plus his slugging percentage. It's usually used as a representation for a player's overall batting performance. Some variables we expect to be useful in modeling the response are the player's age, average exit velocity, and launch angle.
